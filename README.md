# vCD-Catalog


vCloud Director Catalog Powershell Modules


 This was developed off of Jon Waite's original version of New-Catalog
 
 
  I have since added features:
  
  
  - Allow creation of a new subscribed catalog
  - Allow creation of published catalog
  - Modify existing catalog to make it published
  - Error reporting during creation of subscribed catalogs
  - Status reporting and return of published URL for catalogs
